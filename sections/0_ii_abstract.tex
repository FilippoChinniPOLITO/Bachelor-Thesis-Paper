\chapter*{\Large \center Abstract}

An \emph{abstract} is a summary of a research article, thesis, review, conference proceeding, or any in-depth analysis of a particular subject or discipline. It is often used to help the reader quickly ascertain the article's purpose. Therefore, an abstract should be self-contained and understandable on its own. When used, an abstract always appears at the beginning of a manuscript, acting as the entry point for any academic paper or patent application. Abstracting and indexing services for various academic disciplines are aimed at compiling a body of literature for that particular subject.
